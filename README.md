# Tianna Parris - Junior Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Hi, I'm Tianna! I have an analytical background in Biochemistry and currently, I am on track to completing my degree in Data Science (MS. Data Science).I have been in 

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Movie Gross Earnings Analysis
**Code:** [`Python Correlation Project.ipynb`](https://github.com/tiannaparris/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Python%20Correlation%20Project.ipynb)

**Description:** The dataset contains a list of movies released between 1980 and 2022.  The records include the title of the moves, it's rating, genre, release date, budget, gross, etc.. The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, EDA (exploratory data analysis), analyzing correlation between budget and gross earnings and hypothesis testing.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib.

**Results:** Python functions to calculate and plot budget vs gross earnings, hypothesis testing, detecting statistically significant result used to determine that Votes and budget have the highest correlation to gross earnings while the company has none.




### Nashville Housing Data Cleaning
**Code:** [`Data Cleaning Project Queries: Nashville Housing.sql`](https://github.com/tiannaparris/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Data%20Cleaning%20Project%20Queries:%20Nashville%20Housing.sql)

**Description:** The dataset contains a list of houses that have been sold in Nashville between 2013 and 2019. This project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing.


**Skills:** DML(Data Manipulation Language), DQL (Data Query Language), DDL (Data Definition Language)

**Technology:** SQL Server


### Covid 19 Data Exploration
**Code:** [`COVID Portfolio Project.sql`](https://github.com/tiannaparris/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/COVID%20Portfolio%20Project.sql)

**Description:** The dataset contains records of Covid-19 cases, deaths and vaccine records by country in 2020-2021. This project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing and EDA (exploratory data analysis).

**Skills:** Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types

**Technology:** SQL Server


### Covid Cases by Country, 2020-2021 Data visualization
**Tableau Public:** [`dashboard`](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tianna.parris/viz/CovidCasesbyCountry2020-2021/Dashboard1)

**Description:** Tableau Public dashboard consisted of: calculated Covid-19 cases, deaths and death percenatge; chart highlighting the total deaths by continent; analytical chart showing perecentage of the population infected and estimated forecast indicator; filters by location.
**Technology:** Tableau
**Results:** Interactive Dashboard 


## Study Projects
In this section I will provide links to my github repositories containing code and jupyter notebooks I created while passing online courses or was just having fun with.

### Tableau Vizzes
**Description:** My Tableau Public account ---> [go to Tableau..](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tianna.parris)

**Status:** ∞


## Certificates
The best way to showcase skills is by doing and sharing your job done but sometimes certificates appear to be as an indirect result. Here's a list of the ones I have (in reverse-chronological order, with the date of completion in brackets):
